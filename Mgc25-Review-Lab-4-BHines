Looking at this solution I see the library itself in Visual Studio is set up correctly. When looking at 
the code the class1 it is set up with appropriate properties. When looking at the code in DataMngr class 
it looks well set up too(not needing constructors bec it is using lists in the methods, etc). I like the 
use of the methods in DataMngr class, they would definitely save a lot of room in a formâ€™s .cs code. I 
like all the extra comments you added to help explain how DataMngr is working. The only things in this 
solution I would have liked to see is the class1 renamed State in the solution explorer and a comment 
section for the name, class, and assignment, somewhere to help clarify whose code it is (just in case).
